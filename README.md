# Bank On - San Francisco Map

This repository contains the artifacts for rendering a map of [banks recommended by the SF Office of Financial Empowerment](http://bankonsanfrancisco.com/map).

It's based on [@derekeder/FusionTable-Map-Template](https://github.com/derekeder/FusionTable-Map-Template), so it allows end-users to easily search by various filters.

This work was done as part of the nationwide [2013 Code Across America](http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/pages/codeacross) event.
